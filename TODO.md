-https://github.com/nukelets/shroomite/commits/main Plan exceptions for the World interface (so that access/block addition/block removal at invalid positions can be handled with try/catch)
- **Important**: fix fire textures for WoodBlock
- Maybe adjust the rendering resolution to the screen size (having black bars and stuff) -- Viewports

- Implement a simple inventory system
    - Item: capable of interacting with blocks (e.g. create a BreakableBlock class that has some sort of "HP" and have the item decrease it gradually)

- Give the player (maybe the Agent class) some attributes (hp/stamina/etc)
- Add enemies?

- Maybe have a level selection screen, create a few levels


- Review and refactor the code

- Level ideas:
    - Jump over Lava
